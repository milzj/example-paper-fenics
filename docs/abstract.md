# Abstract

Here you can write a little abstract for the paper or some text explaining what the paper is about.


You could also add citation that you can add to the `refs.bib` in the `docs` folder. You can read more about adding citations [here](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html).

In this example we use the LDRB algorithm {cite}`bayer2012novel` to data from {cite}`martinez2019repository`.
